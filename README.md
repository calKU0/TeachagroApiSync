# TechagroSyncServices

> ðŸ’¼ **Commercial Project** â€” part of a private or client-facing initiative.

## Overview

**TechagroSyncServices** is a set of Windows Services that integrate with multiple supplier APIs to automatically fetch data and insert it into a database.  
Each service is independently responsible for processing a different supplierâ€™s API and is fully logged using **Serilog**.

Additionally, the project includes a **Service Manager**, a user-facing interface that allows users to:

- Select which service they want to observe
- View structured logs in real-time
- Start, stop, or restart services
- Monitor service status
- View or modify service configuration settings

This makes monitoring and managing all services simple and intuitive.
